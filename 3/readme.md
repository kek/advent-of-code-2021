# How I run it

I created a Pharo 9.0 image from the launcher, configured SSH keys in settings, and added my repo as an "Iceberg" repository (World menu -> Sources -> Iceberg). From the Iceberg browser (World menu -> Browse -> Iceberg), I can commit and fetch Smalltalk classes from the Git repo into Pharo. To get the results, I open a Playground, enter `PowerConsumptionChecker new powerConsumption.` and click "Do it".
