# How I did it

## Part one

`./run-one`

When the spreadsheet opens in VisiData,

- Go to second column.
- Press +.
- Type "sum".
- Go to first column.
- Press F.
- Press Ctrl-S to save to input__freq.tsv.

Now run ./count-freq-tsv to get the result.

## Part two

`./run-two`

Open the file movements.tsv in Excel and calculate away. See movements.xslx for finished result.
